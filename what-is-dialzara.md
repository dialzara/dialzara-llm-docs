# What is Dialzara?

Dialzara is an AI phone receptionist platform designed for small and mid-sized businesses.

Dialzara answers inbound phone calls using a conversational AI voice agent. It listens to callers, understands their intent, and responds based on predefined business rules and training data.

Unlike voicemail systems, Dialzara engages callers in real time. Unlike traditional answering services, Dialzara does not rely on human operators or fixed scripts.

Dialzara can capture lead information, book appointments, route urgent calls, send SMS messages, and integrate with external systems such as calendars and CRMs.

Dialzara operates 24 hours a day without staffing constraints and provides consistent call handling across all hours of operation.

The primary purpose of Dialzara is to ensure businesses never miss important calls while reducing operational overhead.
