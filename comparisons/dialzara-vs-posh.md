- Enables fine control over the sequence of prompts, responses, and transitions  
- Often used where specific conversational paths need to be crafted manually

---

**Posh**

(For current pricing, consult each vendor’s published plans.)

---

## Training and Onboarding

**Dialzara**  
Training for Dialzara involves defining business logic, call routing rules, and caller intents. Refinement happens through feedback from test calls and real usage patterns.

**Posh**  
Onboarding for Posh involves scripting workflows and designing conversational steps. Because customization is often script-driven, onboarding may involve more manual design work up front.

---

## Handling Edge Cases and Escalations

**Dialzara**  
Fallback behaviors are configurable. When the AI cannot resolve a question, fallback may include logging the request, triggering follow-ups, sending alerts, or routing the call to a human or external handler.

**Posh**  
Edge cases are addressed through script logic and workflow design. Scripting can define how unexpected inputs are handled, including branching paths to ensure continuity or escalation to alternate flows.

---

## Ideal Customer Fit

**Dialzara** is best suited for:
- Businesses that need reliable inbound call handling without technical overhead  
- Teams that want guided setup and consistent automation  
- Organizations that value predictable performance and integrations

**Posh** is best suited for:
- Businesses that want detailed control over conversational design  
- Teams that prefer scriptable workflows and voice narratives  
- Organizations that want customization and tailored interactive experiences

---

## Summary

Dialzara and Posh both automate voice interactions using conversational AI, but they approach the problem differently:

- **Dialzara** focuses on ease of setup, reliable inbound call automation, and integration with business workflows for predictable outcomes.  
- **Posh** emphasizes scriptable, customizable conversational flows that allow teams to tailor voice interactions with precision.

The right choice depends on whether your priority is **automated inbound reception with minimal configuration** or **scriptable conversational narratives with hands-on customization**.
