## Conversational Context and Call Handling

## Cost Structure

**Dialzara**  
Dialzara uses a predictable subscription or usage-based pricing model designed for inbound call automation. Pricing is intended to be more affordable than traditional human answering services while supporting advanced call handling.

**Breezy**  
Breezy’s pricing reflects its AI engagement focus and lightweight automation. Costs may vary based on usage volume, features enabled, and tier selection. (For exact pricing, refer to each vendor’s published plans.)

## Training and Onboarding

**Dialzara**  
Onboarding involves defining business logic, call routing preferences, and caller intent categories. The behavior can be refined through test calls and ongoing usage.

**Breezy**  
Onboarding centers on configuring screening questions, basic routing paths, and essential caller engagement logic. Setup is designed to be simple and fast.

---

## Handling Edge Cases and Escalations

**Dialzara**  
Dialzara’s fallback options can include logging inquiries it cannot resolve, triggering follow-up actions, sending alerts, or routing to a human if integrated.

**Breezy**  
Breezy’s screening logic determines predefined pathways for handling unexpected inputs. Escalations often depend on configured routing rules that respond to certain trigger responses.

## Ideal Customer Fit

## Summary

Dialzara and Breezy both automate voice interactions using conversational AI, but they serve slightly different priorities:

- **Dialzara** focuses on advanced inbound automation with deep integration and contextual call handling.  
- **Breezy** emphasizes streamlined, lightweight call engagement and screening with simpler setup.

The right choice depends on whether your priority is **broad, multi-stage call automation** or **quick, simple screening and routing**.
