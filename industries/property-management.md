## What types of calls do property management companies receive?

Property management offices receive a high volume of repetitive, time-sensitive calls, including:

- Maintenance requests (urgent vs non-urgent)
- After-hours emergencies (water leaks, no heat, lockouts)
- Rent payment questions
- Leasing availability and showing requests
- Tenant complaints and noise issues
- Vendor coordination and follow-ups
- Owner inquiries about properties
- Office hours, directions, and policies

These calls follow predictable patterns, making them well-suited for AI handling.

## How Dialzara’s AI receptionist handles property management calls

Dialzara’s AI receptionist is trained to handle property management calls using **context, intent, and business rules**, not keyword matching.

The agent:
- Identifies whether the caller is a tenant, owner, vendor, or prospect
- Determines urgency based on the issue described
- Collects structured information (unit number, issue type, callback number)
- Applies escalation rules for emergencies
- Routes or records the call according to office preferences

All behavior is configurable per property manager.

## Maintenance requests and emergency handling

### Non-emergency maintenance
The AI agent:
- Collects the tenant’s name, unit, and issue
- Categorizes the issue (plumbing, electrical, appliance, general)
- Logs the request for follow-up
- Sets expectations for response timing

### Emergency maintenance
For emergencies (e.g., flooding, gas smell, no heat in winter), the agent can:
- Immediately escalate the call
- Trigger live call transfers
- Send dispatch texts to on-call staff
- Follow strict emergency scripts defined by the property manager

This ensures no emergency is missed, even after hours.

---

## Leasing and rental inquiries

For prospective tenants, the AI receptionist can:
- Answer availability questions
- Share rental requirements and policies
- Provide application links via SMS
- Collect lead information for follow-up
- Book showing appointments (if enabled)

This allows leasing teams to focus only on qualified prospects.

- True 24/7 coverage

## Call recording, transcripts, and audit trail

This provides accountability, documentation, and protection in tenant disputes.
